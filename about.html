  Hey there! My name is Justin, and I am a developer, designer, maker and all around creator.
</p>

<p>
  Bramble is my personal blog where I will write posts based on the things I have been working on. Sometimes I do software development, sometimes design work, sometimes it is physical computing.
</p>

<p>
  I will use these posts to share my experiences in working on these projects.
